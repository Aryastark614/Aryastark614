Currently, I'm a full stack developer (freelancer) , soaking up as much knowledge and practice as I can in an attempt to perfect my craft. 
I have experience using Typescript, Javascript, Python, Angulr, Node.js, React.js, Mongodb,Dynamodb ,Express.
I've just started diving into lambda functions and S3 storage on AWS (Serverless framework).
As I followed a data-structure, intelligence artificial and algorithms training sessions with Floxus Community. 
My experiences include working  a substitute teacher at the faculty of science of Tunis  since September 2021: computer science  and embedded system course. 
I also have quite a bit of older experience coding in C++ and java (Spring boot).
